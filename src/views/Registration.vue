  <p class="lead">Disability Services at CSU Global is committed to individualized assistance that honors the uniqueness of each student. A conversation about your experiences will help Disability Services identify the types of accommodations that may be appropriate, and the information necessary to support those accommodations. Reach out to Disability Services via email <a href="mailto:ADA@csuglobal.edu">ADA@csuglobal.edu</a> or by phone <a href="tel:1-720-279-0650">(720) 279-0650</a>.</p>


<h2>Register With Us</h2>
<p>1. Self-identify as a student with a disability to Disability Services by emailing <a href="mailto:ADA@csuglobal.edu">ADA@csuglobal.edu</a> or by calling <a href="tel:1-720-279-0650">(720) 279-0650</a>. We will send you an email requesting documentation, two forms to complete and return, and provide the <a href="https://csuglobal.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=56545145" target="_blank">Disability Services Handbook</a>. If you would like to set up a time to speak on the phone to have a more in depth conversation, please don't hesitate to let us know.</p>

While the <a href="https://csuglobal.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=56545145" target="_blank">Disability Services Handbook</a> contains specifics about the information needed for your disability documentation, generally the documentation must include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Current functional limitations in an academic setting due to the disability (Review the Documentation Guidelines in the Disability Services Handbook for your specific disability).</li>

<li>The name, address, telephone and professional credentials of the evaluator on official letterhead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>Once you have submitted the required information, it will be reviewed within 5 business days. Follow up with Disability Services if you have not heard back within 5 business days of submitting your documents.</p>

<p>If academic accommodations have been approved, you will receive a “Student Notification of Academic Accommodations” form detailing your approved accommodations.</p>

<p>Prior to the beginning of each academic term, you must request <a href="mailto:ADA@csuglobal.edu?subject=Faculty%20Notification%20Request&amp;body=Hi There, I would like to request a faculty notification letter for my courses.">Faculty Notification of Academic Accommodations</a> letter(s) from Disability Services for each course that you would like to use your accommodations. You are responsible for sending the letter and discussing accommodations with each of your instructors during the first week of the term. Accommodations become effective the date the letter is delivered to your instructor and are not retroactive.</p>

<p>If you are not approved for academic accommodations at CSU Global, you will be provided an explanation or be asked to submit additional documentation and/or information.</p>
