    <p>As part of this commitment, CSU Global maintains compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. CSU Global recognizes its obligations under Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of a disability and require institutions such as CSU Global to provide reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified disabled students in all University programs and activities. In addition, CSU Global strives to create accessible platforms and materials that enhance stakeholder engagement and evidence-based practices.</p>

    <p>The Institutional Accessibility Policy demonstrates the universityâ€™s commitment to providing equal access to educational resources. CSU Global is dedicated to creating content that is accessible to students of all abilities. University content will be created with accessibility in mind and will adhere to accessible design standards in all student-facing materials, including the website, online courses, learning management system (LMS), portals, library, surveys, etc. These accessible design standards are reviewed by the Institutional Accessibility Committee (IAC) and are approved by governance council. The university will make every effort to ensure that online materials are accessible to all students.</p>
