University content will be created with accessibility in mind and will adhere to accessible design standards in all student-facing materials, including the website, online courses, learning management system (LMS), portals, library, surveys, etc. These accessible design standards are reviewed by the Institutional Accessibility Committee (IAC) and are approved by governance council.
