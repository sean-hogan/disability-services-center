				<p class="lead">Academic accommodations at CSU Global focus on providing equal access to all students in an online education environment. Reasonable accommodations may consist of changes in policies, practices, services, and the use of auxiliary aids.</p>

<h2>Accommodations</h2>

<p>These may include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modifying the deadline for assignments</li>
<li>Modifying the format of course materials</li>
<li>Modifying the way course information is presented</li>
<li>Modifying how a student submits assignments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policies</h2>

<p>Reasonable accommodations do not require a substantial change in the curriculum or alteration of any essential elements or functions of the course, program, service, or activity.</p>

<p>CSU Global understands that reasonable accommodations must be made unless it can be demonstrated that the accommodations would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the program.</p>
