<p>Students with disabilities are expected to complete all academic requirements for their program at CSU Global. All undergraduate students must complete General Education core courses as established through the <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-23-postsecondary-education/co-rev-st-sect-23-1-125.html">Colorado Revised Statute 23-1-125(3)</a>. These courses include Communication, Mathematics, Arts & Humanities, History, Social Sciences, and Natural & Physical Sciences, including a lab. In addition, CSU Global participates in the <a href="http://highered.colorado.gov/Academics/Transfers/gtPathways/curriculum.html">Guaranteed Transfer (GT) Pathways General Education Curriculum</a>. All schools participating in GT Pathways must hold all students to this general curriculum.</p>

<p>CSU Global is accredited through the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The HLC accreditation standards are outlined in the <a href="http://policy.hlcommission.org/Policies/criteria-for-accreditation.html">Criteria for Accreditation</a> and <a href="http://policy.hlcommission.org/Policies/assumed-practices.html">Assumed Practices</a>.</p>

<p>Waiving or substantially altering academic requirements for program completion is generally not considered a reasonable accommodation. This includes General Education requirements as well as requirements considered essential to a student’s major and/or specialization. However, you are always encouraged to contact Disability and Accessibility Services to discuss your options. Your Student Success Counselor can also offer guidance for completing coursework, including taking a course through alternative credits, and accessing resources like Smarthinking online tutoring and CSU Global’s Writing Center.</p>
