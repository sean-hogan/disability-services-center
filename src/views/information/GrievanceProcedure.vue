      <h2>Grievance Procedure for Disability Related Issues</h2>
      <p>
        This grievance procedure is intended to find efficient resolution of
        disability related student issues and provide the opportunity to
        resolve issues at each level of the reporting structure. It is not
        intended to be adversarial or punitive.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the grievance is with the instructor, the student is encouraged
        to resolve their concerns directly with the instructor. If concerns
        are not resolved, the student should contact Disability Services who
        will work with the student, the faculty member and other relevant
        CSU Global personnel to resolve the situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the grievance is with the accommodation process or with
        Disability Services, the student is encouraged to resolve the
        concerns directly with Disability Services within ten business days
        of the initial complaint. If the initial complaint is made after ten
        days, the complaint/grievance will be deemed untimely.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an informal resolution cannot be reached, students have the
        option of filing a formal grievance with the Grievance Committee.
        This must be received, in writing, within ten days of the date the
        informal grievance process ends. To pursue a formal investigation,
        students should be prepared to provide the name of the staff member,
        a detailed summary of the issue or concern, an account of previous
        communication that was attempted to resolve the concern, and a brief
        statement describing the desired outcome. Students can request a
        Grievance Form from their Student Success Counselor, which must be
        submitted with supporting documentation to substantiate the claim.
      </p>

      <p>
        The grievance is reviewed by the Grievance Committee which is a
        subcommittee of the Student Affairs committee. The Grievance
        Committee will review the grievance and communicate the decision
        that is made to all parties involved within five days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any decision of the Grievance Committee may be appealed by the
        student if there is evidence that a significant impropriety in the
        review process occurred. The appeal must be in writing, specify in
        detail the alleged procedural impropriety, and must be filed in the
        Office of the Provost within ten business days of the date of
        receipt of the Grievance Committee's decision. The Provost shall
        review the appeal and the Grievance Committee records and issue a
        decision within ten days. The decision of the Provost is final.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students may also go to the Office for Civil Rights to file a
        complaint.
