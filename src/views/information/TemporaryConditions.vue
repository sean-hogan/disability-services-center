<p class="lead">Disability and Accessibility Services at CSU Global offers a variety of accommodations to qualified students with disabilities. Disability and Accessibility Services also recognizes that some students may experience temporary medical conditions due to injury, surgery, or short-term acute illness during their tenure at CSU Global. Temporary disabilities may include, but are not limited to: broken limbs, hand injuries, concussions, or short-term medical complications.
</p>

<p>Students who experience a temporary medical condition that affects their academic work during a trimester should contact their instructor as soon as possible. CSU Global has late, incomplete, and leave of absence policies that may provide the student with the additional time necessary to complete their coursework. Student Success Counselors can also assist students with policies and options.</p>

<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act does not consider temporary illnesses or conditions as disabilities. However, some students experiencing temporary medical conditions may need access to accommodations similar to students with disabilities. Disability and Accessibility Services may be able to offer limited services to students with temporary medical conditions.</p>
To request temporary accommodations, a student must contact Disability and Accessibility Services, submit medical documentation, and complete two eForms (the Request for Academic Accommodations and the Informed Consent for Information Release). The medical documentation should address how the student is being impacted in the academic setting as a result of the illness or injury and provide a recommendation for accommodations. 
<p>Documentation must include a specific condition, expected duration, as well as the name, professional credentials, address, and telephone of the professional. After reviewing the forms and documentation, Disability and Accessibility Services will determine appropriate temporary academic accommodations.</p>

<p>Students should contact Disability and Accessibility Services as soon as possible to discuss if temporary accommodations are a good option based on their circumstances. Accommodations are not retroactive in coursework.</p>
