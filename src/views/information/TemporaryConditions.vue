<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>Students who experience a temporary medical condition that affects their academic work during a trimester should contact their instructor and Student Success Counselor to discuss options. We also recommend students review information about the following helpful policies:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://csuglobal.edu/student-policies/academic-expectations-policies" target="_blank">CSU Global Late Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://csuglobal.edu/student-policies/credit-and-grading-system-policies" target="_blank">Incomplete Grade Guidelines</a></li>
<li><a href="https://csuglobal.edu/student-policies/enrollment-status-policies" target="_blank">Leave of Absence Policy</a></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>An instructor may request medical documentation specifying the condition and duration of the condition.</p>
<p>Medical conditions that are considered temporary can include injuries, surgeries, or acute illnesses. If a student feels their attendance will be affected by a temporary medical condition, it is up to the student to contact their instructor and Student Success Counselor.</p>
